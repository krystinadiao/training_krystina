      To continue backing up the previous chart, I mapped out the changes of average hours per ticket over time.
  <br/><br/>
      Though these categories all saw various dips and raises throughout the past half year, the ultimate
      ending point is consistently lower than the beginning point, thus showing a solid decrease in average
      hours spent per case.
  <br/><br/>
  The knowledge base implementation date is included as reference, as well as the portal update date.
  The portal update is the update of actually putting a link to the knowledge base on the Connections portal
  that the clients utilize to access the product.<br/><br/>
  Below, you can see the individual department graphs displayed alongside the number of cases that dealt
  with those specific departments.

    A primary reason for the push of a knowledge base was due to the fact that a significant percentage
    of the issues submitted by clients were actually self service questions.  <b>With the right outlet, the clients
    would be able to resolve many of the simple requests on their own.</b>  For example, a large percentage of cases
    were on the issues of adding a retailer, fixing misrouted content, training requests, login and sign-up issues, etc.
<br/><br/>
    These issues are simple and straightfoward to solve, thus putting them through manually, waiting for the support
    team to get back to them, and the back and forth conversations create a lot of excess, unecessary time, for both the
    client and Bazaarvoice.
<br/><br/>
Before the knowledge base, <b>73%</b> of case issues were topics that could be included in the knowledge base.  This
percentage decreased to <b>67.2%</b> after the implementation of the knowledegbase.  Though it is not a significant change,
it is still significant, given the short period the KB has been live (less than two months!).  Since exposure to the knowledge base
is still relatively low, many clients who call and email tickets are still unaware of the existence of a KB.  The support team has
taken the intiative to <b>redirect these clients towards the knowledge base</b> and include in their email footers a direct link
to the KB. <br/><br/>

<b>In about 40 days, 6% less of the Connections tickets are issues that are covered in the knowledge base.</b>

  This information, pulled from Google Analytics, shows the general upward trend of unique visitors to the new knowledge base.
  Though hits vary significantly from day to day, it's visible that more and more clients are becoming aware of the existence
  of a knowledge base and turning towards it for quick answers, rather than submitting a ticket.

    <h1>Conclusion and Actionable Insights</h1>

    The Connections knowledge base is still slowly gaining traction.  A large number of cases are still
    coming in, asking questions that are covered by the knowledge base; however, by looking at the decrease in time
    spent per ticket, and the small, but significant, decrease in cases pertaining to knowledge base information, it is
    clear that many of the clients are being made aware of the KB, being redirected to the KB, and using it for future
    issues.<br/><br/>
    Our initial goals with this project (for the purpose of keeping in line with Product Training's overarching goals) were as follows:
  </br>
  <ul>
    <li>Keep our employees up to date with products</li>
    <li>Make our porducts easy for our customers to use</li>
    <li>Make supporting our products as easy as possible</li>
  </ul>
  Based on these metrics, <b>our goals have been reached!</b>
<br/><br/>
Moving forward, these metrics should continue to be tracked to monitor the growth of the knowledge base, as well as the impact on support.

A few specific actions that can be taken are:<br/>
<ul>
  <li>Focus on issues that continue to recurringly be sumitted as tickets, dsepite being covered in the knowledge base. </li>
  <li>Ensure these issues are well addressed in the KB. </li>
  <li>Examine and see if the issues that are not currently covered by the KB can be covered in the future. </li>
  <li>Continue to advertise the KB to clietns and redirect them if an issue is brought up that is clearly covered. </li>
  <li>Continue to track these vital metrics! </li>
</ul>
